### Back button

A new back button allows the customer to go back to the previous step at any time until they schedule the appointment.

### Speed improvements

We fixed a bug that dramatically decreased the loading time of the data when navigating between pages. Specifically, loading the appointment times is much faster.

### Manager assignment

A manager is now assigned to an appointment when it is scheduled. This manager has the needed service skills to help the customer.

## Email improvements

### Emails to managers

Now that a manager is assigned to an appointment, when an email is sent, the manager is CC'd and recieves a copy of the email.

### Calendar invite attachment

Attached to the email is a calendar invite that allows for integration into a calendar service

### Improved email body text

We improved how date and time are sent as well as other minor grammatical improvements.

## Branches improvements

### Branch details

Each branch now shows its address and how many appointments are available in the next two weeks.

### Branch distance

Branches now show the distance in miles from the customer's current location. Location permissions must be enabled in the browser for it to work correctly.
